Code Review
1.Since in the current project, we are using testng and not Junit, we should remove Junit dependency from pom
2.Updated the chrome driver file since old file was corrupted
3.Added setup and tearDown method in SignInTest Class
4.Added chrome options to disable the browser location notification
5.SignIn button in the modal was present in a frame, code to switch on the frame was missing, added that.
